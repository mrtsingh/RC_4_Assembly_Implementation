# RC_4_Assembly_Implementation
In this project the Rivest cipher stream cipher (RC-4) was implemented in assembly level language using both the standard instructions and psuedo instructions pertaining to RISC-V architecture using the RARS assembler. The project is a part of the other task whereby a complete and novel Secured Lightwieght Crypto MicroProcessor using RISC architecture would be developed and taped out. The keystream and psuedo random bit sequence generation algorithm are a bit modified according to the specific requirements. The Speck Hash Implemented in assembly language may be used as a random S array for RC-4 and the initial seed in speck hash also can be randomised by taking input from LFSR(Linear Feedback shift Registers) depending on clock cycle.
